This is a PYTHON Project which was developed keeping in mind the everlasting need of students for viewing video or audio content on a major website such as 'Youtube'.

Packages/Library Used-:

1.PILLOW -used to image class within it to show the image.

2.URLLIB3-supports thread safety, connection pooling, client-side SSL/TLS verification, file uploads with multipart encoding, helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects, gzip and deflate encoding, and proxy for HTTP and SOCKS.

3.TKINTER(TK) - used for creating graphical user interface.

4.PAFY -python library to download YouTube content and retrieve metadata.

5.IO - allows us to manage the file-related input and output operations.


Files Provided-:

All the necessary images that are used in the graphical user interface are provided in the repository and should be stored offline in the same location where 'main.py' is executed.


Way Of Execution-:

After installing all the necessary python library via the pip or pip3 command in the command ,
1. Run the main.py file.

2. open a seperate browser tab and paste the required or desired url of the video in youtube.
    - You can use the url that is stored in the 'share' button below the video player embed in the youtube.
  
3. After pasting , Click the 'search' button and wait a few seconds to load the 'quality' option in the GUI.

4. After selecting the desired quallity, click the 'download' button.

5. If file is downloaded , it is stored in the same the destination location where python program 'main.py' is executed.

6. If file is not downloaded, and error message such as 'something is wrong with the url' is shown, then no need to worry, Try again. It will work.


Limitation-:

Since python module 'PAFY' is quite limited in it's usage. That is one of the main reason due to which program fails a few times.
This is a exciting project for all the 'PYTHON' Enthusiast or Curious and exciting heads out there!

Be Good and Spread Positivity!
